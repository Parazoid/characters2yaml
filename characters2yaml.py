# characters2yaml by Paradox
# Special thanks to longbyte1/oldmud0 for some code snippets and inspiration.
"""

This script extracts character names from each character folder in the /base/characters directory of AO2 
and compiles it into a 'characters.yaml' file for quick tsuserver3 configuration.

To use it, simply place the script in the characters folder you wish to extract 
names from and run it, it will output a 'characters.yaml' file after finishing. 
If a 'characters.yaml' yaml file already exists in the current directory the script 
will add any new characters to the "Uncategorized" category at the bottom of the file.

This requires the pyYAML module and Python 3.6 or higher.
