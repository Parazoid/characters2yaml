# characters2yaml by Paradox
# Thanks to longbyte1/oldmud0 for inspiration and argoneus for suggestions.

"""

This script extracts character names from each character folder in the /base/characters directory of AO2 
and compiles it into a 'characters.yaml' file for quick tsuserver3 configuration.

To use it, simply place the script in the characters folder you wish to extract 
names from and run it, it will output a 'characters.yaml' file after finishing. 
If a 'characters.yaml' file already exists in the current directory the script 
will ask if you wish to overwrite.


This script requires the pyYAML module and Python 3.6 or higher.
