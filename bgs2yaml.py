# bgs2yaml by Paradox
# Thanks to longbyte1/oldmud0 for inspiration.

"""

This script extracts background names from each background folder in the /base/background directory of AO2 
and compiles it into a 'backgrounds.yaml' file for quick tsuserver3 configuration.

To use it, simply place the script in the  folder you wish to extract 
names from and run it, it will output a 'backgrounds.yaml' file after finishing. 
If a 'backgrounds.yaml' file already exists in the current directory the script 
will ask if you wish to overwrite.

This script requires the pyYAML module and Python 3.6 or higher.
